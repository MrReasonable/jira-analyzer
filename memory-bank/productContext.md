# Jira Analyzer Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Jira Analyzer exists to bridge the gap between raw Jira data and actionable team insights. While Jira excels at issue tracking and workflow management, its native reporting capabilities often fall short for teams seeking deeper workflow analytics. Development teams need specialized metrics to optimize their processes, but these insights are buried in Jira's data structure and require significant effort to extract manually.

This tool transforms raw Jira data into meaningful visualizations that help teams understand their workflow efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions to improve their development processes.

## Problems It Solves

### Lack of Specialized Metrics Visualization

- Jira's native dashboards provide basic reporting but lack specialized development metrics
- Teams struggle to visualize critical workflow data like lead times, cycle times, and work in progress
- Decision-makers lack the quantitative data needed for process optimization

### Configuration Complexity

- Setting up custom Jira dashboards requires significant expertise
- Teams waste time recreating similar reports across different projects
- Analysis parameters need to be frequently adjusted but are difficult to save and reuse

### Workflow Visibility Gaps

- Bottlenecks in development processes remain hidden without proper visualization
- Work distribution across workflow states is difficult to analyze
- Historical trends in team performance are challenging to track and compare

### Data Accessibility

- Extracting meaningful metrics from Jira often requires manual data processing
- Teams lack a consistent, reliable source of workflow analytics
- Stakeholders need accessible visuals rather than raw data

## How It Should Work

### Core Operational Principles

1. **Configuration-Based Analysis**

   - Users create named configurations with Jira credentials and project parameters
   - Configurations are saved for quick reuse and sharing
   - Each configuration can specify custom workflow states and JQL filters

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**

   - Application connects securely to Jira's API using stored credentials
   - Raw issue data is extracted based on JQL queries
   - Backend processes data into standardized metrics
   - Results are transformed into visual representations

3. **Workflow Customization**

   - Users define their workflow states to match their Jira process
   - Start and end points for lead/cycle time calculations are configurable
   - The system adapts to different team workflows rather than enforcing a specific process

4. **On-Demand Analysis**
   - Users trigger analysis when needed rather than continuous processing
   - Results are presented immediately without requiring report generation
   - Metrics recalculate when parameters change

## User Experience Goals

### Simplicity and Clarity

- Intuitive interface that requires minimal training
- Clear visualizations that are immediately understandable
- Straightforward configuration process with guided steps

### Focus on Insights

- Emphasize data interpretation over data collection
- Surface meaningful patterns and trends automatically
- Provide context and comparison points for metrics

### Flexibility

- Adapt to different Jira configurations and workflow styles
- Support various team sizes and methodologies (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)
- Allow for customization without requiring programming knowledge

### Efficiency

- Minimize the steps required to get from data to insight
- Optimize performance even with large datasets
- Enable quick switching between different configurations and views

### Independence

- Function as a standalone tool without requiring Jira modifications
- Preserve security through secure credential management
- Operate without disrupting existing Jira usage
