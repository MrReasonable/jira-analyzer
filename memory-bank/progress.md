# Jira Analyzer Progress Report

## What Works

### Core Functionality

- Configuration creation and management
- Jira instance connection and authentication
- JQL-based issue filtering
- Workflow state customization and management
- Chart rendering for all planned metrics:
  - Lead Time visualization
  - Throughput analysis
  - Work in Progress (WIP) monitoring
  - Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)
  - Cycle Time measurements

### Technical Implementation

- Frontend component architecture and reactive state management
- Backend API endpoints and service layer
- Docker-based development and deployment pipeline
- End-to-end test framework with Playwright
- Comprehensive unit test coverage

## What's Left to Build

### Feature Enhancements

- User preferences and profile settings
- Advanced JQL builder interface
- Data export functionality for metrics
- Custom date range selector for analysis
- Additional chart types and visualization options

### Technical Improvements

- Performance optimizations for large datasets
- Advanced caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Expanded error handling and user feedback
- Accessibility improvements throughout the UI
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Current Status

### Development Progress

- **Frontend**: 85% complete
  - Core components implemented and functioning
  - Workflow editor needs final polish
  - Form validation enhancements in progress
- **Backend**: 90% complete
  - API endpoints implemented for all planned features
  - Rate limiting and caching implemented
  - Additional error handling being added
- **Testing**: 85% complete
  - Unit test coverage above 80%
  - End-to-end tests covering critical paths
  - API client tests refactored to focus on behavior over implementation
  - Unit testing documentation expanded with best practices
  - Performance testing framework being set up

### Current Sprint Focus

- Enhancing the workflow state management experience
- Improving configuration saving and validation
- Optimizing chart rendering for better performance
- Expanding test coverage for edge cases

## Known Issues

### Open Bugs

- Intermittent errors when saving configurations with special characters
- Chart rendering inconsistencies with very large datasets
- Workflow editor occasionally fails to update state on drag operations
- JQL validation doesn't provide specific enough error messages

### Technical Debt

- Some components need refactoring for better separation of concerns
- Backend service layer needs additional error handling
- Test mocks could be more comprehensive
- Documentation needs expansion in several areas

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

- **Initial Plan**: Considered using React with Redux
- **Current Approach**: Adopted SolidJS with custom hooks for better performance
- **Rationale**: Better performance with reactive primitives and simpler state management

### Backend Framework

- **Initial Plan**: Considered Django for the backend
- **Current Approach**: Implemented with FastAPI
- **Rationale**: Better async support and built-in API documentation

### State Management

- **Initial Plan**: Considered global state management library
- **Current Approach**: Using composition of custom hooks
- **Rationale**: More maintainable and testable code structure with clearer data flow

### Chart Rendering

- **Initial Plan**: Considered using off-the-shelf chart components
- **Current Approach**: Custom chart components with D3.js integration
- **Rationale**: Greater flexibility for specialized metrics visualization

### Testing Strategy

- **Initial Plan**: Focused primarily on unit testing
- **Current Approach**: Balanced approach with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Rationale**: Better coverage of real-world user scenarios and integration points
