# Jira Analyzer Progress Report

> **Executive Summary:** The project is 85-90% complete with core functionality working. Frontend components, workflow editor, and backend API endpoints are implemented. Current focus is on enhancing workflow state management, improving configuration validation, and optimizing chart rendering. Known issues include intermittent errors with special characters and chart rendering inconsistencies with large datasets.

## What Works

### Core Functionality

- Configuration creation and management
- Jira instance connection and authentication
- JQL-based issue filtering
- Workflow state customization and management
- Chart rendering for all planned metrics:
  - Lead Time visualization
  - Throughput analysis
  - Work in Progress (WIP) monitoring
  - Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD)
  - Cycle Time measurements

### Technical Implementation

- Frontend component architecture and reactive state management
- Backend API endpoints and service layer
- Docker-based development and deployment pipeline
- End-to-end test framework with Playwright
- Comprehensive unit test coverage
- Documentation anchor verification system for code-doc synchronization
- Pre-commit hooks for automated documentation verification

## What's Left to Build

### Feature Enhancements

- User preferences and profile settings
- Advanced JQL builder interface
- Data export functionality for metrics
- Custom date range selector for analysis
- Additional chart types and visualization options

### Technical Improvements

- Performance optimizations for large datasets
- Advanced caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Expanded error handling and user feedback
- Accessibility improvements throughout the UI
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## Current Status

### Development Progress

- **Frontend**: 85% complete
  - Core components implemented and functioning
  - Workflow editor needs final polish
  - Form validation enhancements in progress
- **Backend**: 90% complete
  - API endpoints implemented for all planned features
  - Rate limiting and caching implemented
  - Additional error handling being added
- **Testing**: 85% complete
  - Unit test coverage above 80%
  - End-to-end tests covering critical paths
  - API client tests refactored to focus on behavior over implementation
  - Unit testing documentation expanded with best practices
  - Performance testing framework being set up

### Current Sprint Focus

- Enhancing the workflow state management experience
- Improving configuration saving and validation
- Optimizing chart rendering for better performance
- Expanding test coverage for edge cases

## Known Issues

### Open Bugs

- Intermittent errors when saving configurations with special characters
- Chart rendering inconsistencies with very large datasets
- Workflow editor occasionally fails to update state on drag operations
- JQL validation doesn't provide specific enough error messages

### Technical Debt

- Some components need refactoring for better separation of concerns
- Backend service layer needs additional error handling
- Test mocks could be more comprehensive
- Documentation needs expansion in several areas

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

- **Initial Plan**: Considered using React with Redux
- **Current Approach**: Adopted SolidJS with custom hooks for better performance
- **Rationale**: Better performance with reactive primitives and simpler state management
- **Latest Evolution**: Formalized SOLID principles, CQRS pattern, and functional decomposition (Added)
- **Rationale**: Improved maintainability, testability, and separation of concerns

### Backend Framework

- **Initial Plan**: Considered Django for the backend
- **Current Approach**: Implemented with FastAPI
- **Rationale**: Better async support and built-in API documentation

### State Management

- **Initial Plan**: Considered global state management library
- **Current Approach**: Using composition of custom hooks
- **Rationale**: More maintainable and testable code structure with clearer data flow

### Chart Rendering

- **Initial Plan**: Considered using off-the-shelf chart components
- **Current Approach**: Custom chart components with D3.js integration
- **Rationale**: Greater flexibility for specialized metrics visualization

### Testing Strategy

- **Initial Plan**: Focused primarily on unit testing
- **Current Approach**: Balanced approach with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Rationale**: Better coverage of real-world user scenarios and integration points
