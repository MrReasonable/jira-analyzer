# Jira Analyzer Project Brief

## Project Definition

Jira Analyzer is a specialized analytics tool that extracts, processes, and visualizes workflow metrics from Jira to help teams gain insights into their development processes.

## Core Requirements

### Primary Goals

1. Provide accurate, actionable metrics derived from Jira issue data
2. Support customizable workflow analysis for different team processes
3. Present metrics through intuitive visualizations
4. Enable teams to save and reuse analysis configurations
5. Maintain secure handling of Jira credentials and data

### Technical Requirements

1. Web-based application with responsive interface
2. Secure integration with Jira's API
3. Persistent storage for configurations
4. Containerized deployment for consistent environments
5. Comprehensive test coverage for reliability

### Metrics Requirements

1. Lead Time tracking from issue creation to completion
2. Cycle Time measurement for specific workflow transitions
3. Throughput analysis to track completion rates
4. Work in Progress (WIP) monitoring
5. Cumulative Flow Diagram for visualizing workflow distribution

## Project Scope

### Included

- JQL-based filtering and analysis
- Secure storage of Jira credentials
- Configuration management (create, edit, save, delete)
- Workflow state definition and customization
- Chart generation for all required metrics
- User-friendly, responsive interface
- Docker-based deployment
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

### Excluded

- Direct modification of Jira issues or workflows
- Generation of custom reports beyond the defined metrics
- Integration with non-Jira issue tracking systems
- Historical trend analysis beyond the data available in Jira

## Success Criteria

1. Users can connect to any Jira instance with proper credentials
2. Configurations are correctly saved and retrieved
3. All specified metrics are accurately calculated and visualized
4. Interface is intuitive and responsive
5. Analysis can be performed on different projects with different workflows
6. Application performs efficiently even with large datasets

## Constraints

1. Must work with both Jira Cloud and Jira Server instances
2. Must handle Jira rate limiting appropriately
3. Must process data efficiently without excessive memory usage
4. Must secure sensitive credential information
