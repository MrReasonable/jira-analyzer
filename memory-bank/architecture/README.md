# Architectural Decision Records

> **Executive Summary:** This directory will contain Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) for the Jira Analyzer application. Currently, the ADRs are planned but not yet implemented. When created, they will document key architectural decisions including the selection of SolidJS for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, custom hooks for state management, SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL for the database, JWT for authentication, and Docker for deployment.

## Purpose

These documents will provide:

- Clear documentation of architectural decisions
- Context and reasoning behind each decision
- Alternatives that were considered
- Consequences and trade-offs of each decision
- References to related decisions

By documenting these decisions, we prevent the need to re-analyze them in the future, saving time and effort during development and maintenance. This documentation also helps new team members understand the reasoning behind the current architecture.

## Planned Contents

The following Architectural Decision Records are planned for future implementation:

- **ADR-001: Frontend Framework Selection** - Decision to use SolidJS

  - Context: Need for a reactive, performant frontend framework
  - Decision: SolidJS selected over React, Vue, and Angular
  - Alternatives: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte
  - Consequences: Better performance, smaller bundle size, learning curve

- **ADR-002: Backend Framework Selection** - Decision to use FastAPI

  - Context: Need for a modern, high-performance Python web framework
  - Decision: FastAPI selected over Flask and Django
  - Alternatives: Flask, Django, Express.js
  - Consequences: Better performance, type safety, OpenAPI documentation

- **ADR-003: State Management Approach** - Decision to use custom hooks over global state

  - Context: Need for maintainable state management
  - Decision: Custom hooks with local state over global state management
  - Alternatives: Redux, MobX, Zustand
  - Consequences: Better encapsulation, simpler testing, more explicit data flow

- **ADR-004: Database Selection** - Decision to use SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL

  - Context: Need for reliable data persistence
  - Decision: SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL
  - Alternatives: MongoDB, MySQL, SQLite
  - Consequences: Type safety, migration support, relational integrity

- **ADR-005: Authentication Strategy** - Decision to use JWT for authentication

  - Context: Need for secure, stateless authentication
  - Decision: JWT tokens for authentication
  - Alternatives: Session-based auth, OAuth
  - Consequences: Stateless operation, simpler scaling, token management

- **ADR-006: Deployment Strategy** - Decision to use Docker for deployment
  - Context: Need for consistent deployment environments
  - Decision: Docker containers for all services
  - Alternatives: Virtual machines, serverless
  - Consequences: Environment consistency, isolation, orchestration options
