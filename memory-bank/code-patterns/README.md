# Code Pattern Examples

This directory contains concrete examples of code patterns used throughout the Jira Analyzer application. These examples serve as reference implementations that can be used as templates when implementing new features or refactoring existing code.

## Purpose

These documents provide:

- Concrete code examples of architectural patterns in use
- Reusable templates for common implementation scenarios
- Practical demonstrations of best practices
- Reference implementations to ensure consistency

By documenting these patterns with real code examples, we reduce the need to analyze the entire codebase to understand how patterns are applied in practice. This makes it easier to maintain consistency and follow established patterns when implementing new features.
