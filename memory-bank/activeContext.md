# Jira Analyzer Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The development is currently focused on:

1. **Workflow Management Functionality**

   - Implementing the workflow state management system
   - Enhancing the workflow editor component for intuitive state configuration
   - Improving integration between workflow definitions and metrics calculations

2. **Configuration Form Enhancement**

   - Refining the configuration saving process
   - Implementing name availability checking for configurations
   - Streamlining the credentials management workflow

3. **Backend API Optimization**
   - Improving the Jira API integration performance
   - Enhancing error handling and validation in the configuration routes
   - Implementing caching strategies for better performance

## Recent Changes

1. **Frontend Improvements**

   - Implemented the WorkflowEditor component with drag-and-drop functionality
   - Added configuration management hooks (useConfigSaver, useNameAvailability)
   - Enhanced form validation and submission process

2. **Backend Enhancements**

   - Refined the dependency injection container implementation
   - Improved error handling in the Jira API integration
   - Added rate limiting middleware to protect against API abuse

3. **Testing and Quality**
   - Added comprehensive test coverage for workflow management
   - Implemented end-to-end tests for configuration workflows
   - Enhanced chart rendering tests for metrics visualization
   - Improved API client tests to focus on behavior rather than implementation details
   - Updated unit testing documentation with best practices for maintainable tests

## Next Steps

1. **Short-term Priorities**

   - Complete workflow state validation and error handling
   - Finalize the configuration form submission process
   - Improve error messaging for failed Jira API connections

2. **Medium-term Goals**

   - Enhance chart visualizations with additional options
   - Implement data export functionality for metrics
   - Add user preferences for default views and settings

3. **Technical Improvements**
   - Optimize the data processing pipeline for large datasets
   - Enhance caching strategies for repeated queries
   - Improve test performance for the end-to-end test suite

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Architecture Decisions**

   - Using custom hooks for state management instead of a global state library
   - Maintaining separate routes for different API concerns
   - Implementing server-side validation to complement client-side validation

2. **Performance Considerations**

   - Balancing between realtime calculations and precomputed metrics
   - Managing memory usage for large Jira datasets
   - Optimizing chart rendering for responsive display

3. **User Experience Trade-offs**
   - Finding the right balance between simplicity and configurability
   - Determining the appropriate level of workflow customization
   - Deciding on automatic vs. manual workflow state detection

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**

   - Custom hooks for specific functional domains
   - Component composition with clear separation of concerns
   - Service-oriented backend with dependency injection

2. **Testing Approach**

   - Component tests focusing on behavior rather than implementation
   - Comprehensive test coverage for critical paths
   - Dedicated test files for complex scenarios (empty data, error states)

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Docker-based development environment
   - Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline
   - Pre-commit hooks and automated formatting

## Learnings and Project Insights

1. **Technical Insights**

   - SolidJS provides excellent performance for reactive UI updates
   - FastAPI's dependency injection system pairs well with SQLAlchemy
   - Docker Compose streamlines the development experience significantly

2. **Process Improvements**

   - End-to-end testing required specific optimizations for reliability
   - Chart rendering tests benefit from specific testing utilities
   - Workflow state management requires careful consideration of edge cases

3. **User Feedback**
   - Configuration saving needs clearer success/failure indicators
   - Workflow state editing is more intuitive with visual representations
   - JQL input benefits from validation and suggestions
