> **Current Focus**: Improving end-to-end test reliability with strict selector strategy and fail-fast approach

## Current Sprint Goals

- Enhance end-to-end test reliability
- Eliminate silent failures in tests
- Standardize selector strategy across all tests
- Ensure tests fail immediately when elements aren't found
- Remove all fallback mechanisms and retry loops

## Key Development Activities

### End-to-End Test Reliability Enhancement

- Created a new document defining [test selector strategy](./testing/test-selector-strategy.md)
- Updated [test reliability guidelines](./testing/test-reliability.md) to prohibit fallback selectors
- Updated [e2e testing documentation](./testing/e2e-testing.md) to enforce single selector approach
- Refactored core test utilities to follow the single reliable selector approach:
  - Eliminated fallback selectors in `src/utils/selector-helper.ts`
  - Removed silent retries from `src/core/workflow-states.ts`
  - Standardized configuration operations in `src/core/configuration.ts`
  - Improved state management in `src/core/state-management.ts`

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Single Reliable Selector**: Each element must be accessed using exactly one consistent, reliable selector.
2. **No Fallbacks**: Never implement multiple selector strategies with fallbacks.
3. **Fail Fast**: Tests must fail immediately when elements cannot be found.
4. **Explicit Assertions**: All assertions must include descriptive messages.
5. **Clear Error Messages**: Error messages should help diagnose the real issue.

### Implementation Strategy

- Use `data-testid` as the primary selector method
- Add explicit assertions with clear error messages
- Remove all try/catch blocks that mask failures
- Replace fallback mechanisms with direct assertions
- Ensure tests fail appropriately when elements aren't found

## Recent Design Decisions
