## Purpose

These documents provide:

- Performance optimization strategies for different parts of the application

- Best practices for writing performant code
- Benchmarking and profiling approaches

By documenting performance optimization strategies, we reduce the need to rediscover optimization techniques and ensure consistent performance across the application.
