## Purpose

These documents provide:

- Visual representation of component relationships
- Documentation of data flow between components
- Explanation of component responsibilities
- Guidelines for component composition and reuse

By documenting the component structure, we reduce the need to analyze the entire codebase to understand how components interact. This makes it easier to modify existing components or add new ones that integrate well with the current structure.
